# Multiagent_poetry (WIP)
* Dataset (Quatrain) 
* Experiment \
** shared-memery+chaining: GPT4 \
** social-network: GPT2 \
  - munipulation of losses: token-level (inverted loss, unlikelihood loss), sequence-level loss (unlikelihood loss), sentence-level (supervised contrastive loss), add prefix (prompt level)
notes: reproducibility, save checkpoints at different times, \
expected outputs: poetry generated by each agents, manipulate the network, opinion dynamics, \
* Evaluation of outputs \
** Influence of the network \
** Boost creativity? \
** boost diversity?
